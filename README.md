# Brazil-Students-Sex-Abuse-Data-Analysis
Study based on IBGE's PeNSE 2015

Unfortunately, my interactive graphs made with Plotly are not available at GitHub due to its static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a Plotly graph. See https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-jupyter-notebook-files-on-github/

**To avoid that, please consider open it at [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_7g8kuF1rHYoboHz3552W0SUVAjJaJBX?usp=sharing)**
